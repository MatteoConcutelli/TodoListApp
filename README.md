# TodoListApp

This is an university project that involved the development of an Android application for shared to-do lists using Android Studio for the frontend and Java for the backend. The application enables users to create, manage, and share to-do lists collaboratively with others. It was a rewarding experience integrating frontend and backend technologies to deliver a seamless user experience.
